# 🚀 ThugCorp Docker Setup - Quick Start Guide

Your Next.js application is now fully containerized and ready to run! Here's everything you need to know.

## 📋 What was created

### Core Docker Files
- `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage production build
- `Dockerfile.dev` - Development container with hot reload
- `docker-compose.yml` - Orchestration for all services
- `.dockerignore` - Optimized build context

### Configuration & Scripts
- `nginx.conf` - Production reverse proxy config
- `docker.sh` - Management script for easy operations
- `deploy.sh` - Quick deployment script
- `.env.example` - Environment variables template

### Application Updates
- `next.config.mjs` - Added standalone output for Docker
- `app/api/health/route.ts` - Health check endpoint

## 🎯 Quick Commands

### Start Production (Recommended)
```bash
# Using the management script
./docker.sh prod

# Or directly with compose
docker-compose up --build -d
```
**→ App will be available at http://localhost:3000**

### Development Mode
```bash
# With hot reloading
./docker.sh dev

# Or directly
docker-compose --profile dev up --build thugcorp-dev
```
**→ Dev server at http://localhost:3001**

### Other Operations
```bash
./docker.sh status    # Check service status
./docker.sh logs      # View logs
./docker.sh stop      # Stop all services
./docker.sh clean     # Full cleanup
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Services Available
- **thugcorp-app** (default) - Production Next.js app
- **thugcorp-dev** (dev profile) - Development with hot reload
- **nginx** (nginx profile) - Reverse proxy for scaling

### Production Scaling
```bash
# With Nginx load balancer
docker-compose --profile nginx up -d

# Scale app instances
docker-compose up --scale thugcorp-app=3 -d
```

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Environment Variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your settings
```

### Direct Deployment
```bash
./deploy.sh deploy    # Build and run
./deploy.sh status    # Check status
./deploy.sh logs      # Follow logs
```

### Health Monitoring
